Thrilled to share my latest project - a Data Professional Survey Takers Portfolio Project in Power BI.

I created this portfolio project to highlight my experience and capabilities in data analysis and visualization.

This project showcases my ability to translate complex data into actionable insights and presents my skills in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner.
